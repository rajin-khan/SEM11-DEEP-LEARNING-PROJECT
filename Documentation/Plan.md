## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: LLaVA too slow for real-time feedback  
**Mitigation**: Use smaller model or optimize inference

**Risk**: Memory system becomes too large  
**Mitigation**: Implement aggressive pruning and compression

**Risk**: RLHF doesn't improve performance  
**Mitigation**: Fall back to simpler threshold adjustment

### Timeline Risks
**Risk**: Integration takes longer than expected  
**Mitigation**: Have working components by Week 4, focus on integration

**Risk**: Evaluation reveals poor performance  
**Mitigation**: Focus on specific improvements rather than general performance
