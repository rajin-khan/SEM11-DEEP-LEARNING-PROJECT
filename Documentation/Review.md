# Literature Review: Computer Vision Training Pipeline Research

## What We're Trying to Do
**Problem**: Current CV models need massive datasets for each new task  
**Our Idea**: Combine few-shot learning + human feedback + memory systems to learn from just a few examples

## What Already Exists

### Few-Shot Learning
- **Works**: Models like MAML, Prototypical Networks can learn from 1-5 examples
- **Popular**: CLIP, LLaVA show great few-shot performance on vision tasks
- **Gap**: No integration with human feedback for continuous improvement

### Human Feedback (RLHF) 
- **Works Great**: ChatGPT, Claude use RLHF to align with human preferences
- **Vision**: Barely explored - mostly just image generation, not recognition
- **Gap**: Nobody has applied RLHF to few-shot computer vision tasks

### Memory & Continual Learning
- **Problem**: Models forget old tasks when learning new ones (catastrophic forgetting)
- **Solutions**: Episodic memory, experience replay work but are expensive
- **Gap**: No efficient memory systems for vision + human feedback combination

### Self-Assessment
- **Missing**: Models can't tell when they're ready for deployment
- **Current**: Humans manually decide when model is "good enough"
- **Gap**: No autonomous readiness prediction for vision models

## What's Missing (Our Opportunity)

| Research Area | Status | Gap We Fill |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Few-shot CV | ✓ Exists | + Human feedback integration |
| RLHF | ✓ In NLP | First application to CV few-shot |
| Memory Systems | ✓ Basic | + Cross-modal efficiency |
| Auto-Assessment | ✗ Missing | + Meta-learning for readiness |

## Key Papers That Support Our Approach

**Few-Shot Learning**: 
- [Lin et al. (2024): "Few-shot Adaptation of Multi-modal Foundation Models: A Survey"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01736) - Shows multimodal models replacing traditional approaches
- [Finn et al. (2017): "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning" (MAML)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400) - Foundation of gradient-based meta-learning
- [Snell et al. (2017): "Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175) - Metric learning for few-shot classification

**RLHF Potential**: 
- RLHF technique trains reward models with human feedback for AI alignment
- Gap: Vision applications remain "largely unexplored" compared to language

**Memory Systems**: 
- Catastrophic forgetting is extensively studied, but episodic memory solutions are expensive
- Recent work shows promise in medical imaging but lacks general CV application

## Why Our Research Matters

### Novel Contributions
1. **First RLHF + Few-Shot CV**: Nobody has combined these successfully
2. **Autonomous Readiness**: Models that know when they're deployment-ready  
3. **Efficient Memory**: Cross-modal episodic learning without massive storage
4. **Practical Focus**: Works with small models (<4B params) on real tasks (OCR)

### Real-World Impact
- **Reduces Data Needs**: Learn from 1-5 examples instead of thousands
- **Continuous Improvement**: Gets better through human feedback
- **Self-Monitoring**: Knows when it needs more training
- **Cost Effective**: No need for massive datasets or compute

## Research Validation

**What Literature Shows**:
- Few-shot learning works but needs human guidance
- RLHF works amazingly for language, untested for vision  
- Memory systems prevent forgetting but are resource-heavy
- Nobody has built systems that self-assess readiness

**What We'll Prove**:
- RLHF improves few-shot vision performance
- Smart memory systems prevent forgetting efficiently  
- Meta-learning can predict deployment readiness
- Integration works better than individual components

## Bottom Line

**Strong Foundation**: Each component (few-shot, RLHF, memory) proven individually  
**Clear Gap**: Nobody has combined them for computer vision  
**Practical Value**: Addresses real problem of expensive CV training  
**Novel Research**: First systematic exploration of this intersection  
**Feasible Timeline**: 8-week sprint focuses on core proof-of-concept

**Research Positioning**: We're not inventing new algorithms - we're intelligently combining proven techniques to solve a practical problem that nobody has tackled systematically.
